This repository contains my coursework assignment for the Algorithms and Data Structures module, completed during my second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

### Assignment Overview

In this assignment, I implemented the following algorithms:

- **Prim's Algorithm:** For finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a weighted connected graph.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Another approach for determining the minimum spanning tree of a weighted connected graph.
- **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Tree (SPT) Algorithm:** For finding the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a graph.
- **Depth First Traversal:** Implemented using recursion to explore nodes and edges in a graph.
- **Breadth First Traversal:** Implemented using a queue to systematically explore nodes level by level.

**Grade Received: 95%**

This assignment showcases my ability to apply algorithmic concepts to solve complex problems in graph theory and data structures.
