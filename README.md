This is my CA assignment for the Algorithms and Data Structures module in the second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

In this assignment, I implemented Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree for a weighted connected graph and Dijkstra's shortest path tree (SPT) algorithm. I also implemented depth first traversal using recursion and breadth first traversal using a queue.
